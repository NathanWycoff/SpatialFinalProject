	I will use the diff eq's from \cite{okubo1989spatial}. I will use data from \cite{reynolds1985details}. In \cite{parker2008gray}, red squirrel density in areas occupied only be red squirrels was estimated to be 0.39/ha based on Capture Mark Recapture methods. MoM estimation used to estimate IG prior. For more IG param estimation see \cite{llera2016estimating}
